disease is all around us.Disease-causing agents，such as viruses，usually have specific targets.Some viruses affect only humans; other viruses live in or affect only animals.Problems start when animal viruses are able to infect people as well，a process known as zoonosis.When an animal virus passes to a human，the results can be fatal.Often our immune systems are not accustomed to these viruses and are unable to stop them before they harm us，and even kill us.</p><p>In the last three decades，more than 30 zoonotic diseases have emerged around the globe.HIV is an example.It evolved from a virus originally carried by African monkeys，and later chimps.Today conservative estimates suggest that HIV has infected more than 70 million people in the past three decades，though this number may be higher.SARS，a type of flu that jumped from chickens to humans，is another type of zoonotic disease.</p><p>But how do these viruses pass from animals to humans? Contact is crucial.Human destruction of animal habitats，for example，is forcing wild animals to move closer to places where people live&mdash;putting humans at risk for exposure to animal viruses.The closer humans are to animals，the greater the risk of being bitten，scratched or exposed to animal waste which can enable a virus to pass from an animal to a human.Raising animals (for example，on a farm) or keeping certain kinds of animal and wild animals (like monkeys) as pets increases the risk of exposure.Eating animals that are diseased can also result in the virus being transmitted.</p><p>The factor that is probably most responsible for the spread of some zoonotic diseases worldwide is international travel.In 1999，for example，a deadly disease&mdash;one that had never been seen before in the western hemisphere&mdash;appeared in the United States.There were several incidents that year of both birds and people becoming sick and dying in New York City，and doctors could not explain why.Subsequently，they discovered that the deaths had been caused by the same thing: the West Nile virus，found typically in birds and transmitted by mosquitoes that live in parts of northern Africa.Somehow this virus probably carried by an infected mosquito or bird on a plane or ship arrived in the US.Now，birds and mosquitoes native to North America are carriers of this virus as well.</p><p>Today researchers are working to create vaccines for many of these zoonotic diseases in the hope of controlling their impact on humans.Other specialists are trying to make communities more aware of disease prevention and treatment and to help people understand that we are all&mdash;humans，animals，and insects&mdash;in this together.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-11-04T14:39:40","decipherment":"本文是一篇说明文。文章介绍了引起人畜共患疾病的病毒及其传播方式。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":null,"difficultyName":null,"gradeId":null,"id":"795179558763501445","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":2,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":3217532,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2022-11-04T06:58:31.060","uploadBatch":"1667543980503","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"ordered":8,"question":{"answer":"C","answerExplanation":"<p>推理判断题。根据第一段倒数第二句可知，如果不能模仿他人的面部表情，读懂和正确回应他人表情的能力就会受限，由此推知，面部模仿有助于对别人的表情作出合理反应。故选C。</p>","cityId":null,"content":"<p>According

It makes everyone in the room feel better because they，consciously or unconsciously，are smiling with you.Growing evidence shows that an instinct for facial mimicry(模仿) allows us to experience other people's feelings.If we can't mirror another person's face，it limits our ability to read and properly react to their expressions.A review of this emotional mirroring appears on February 11 in <i>Trends</i> <i>in</i> <i>Cogniti</i><i>v</i><i>e</i> <i>Sciences</i>.</p><p>In their paper，Paula Niedenthal and Adrienne Wood，social psychologists at the University of Wisconsin，describe how people in social situations copy others' facial expressions to create emotional responses in themselves.For example，if you're with a friend who looks sad，you might &ldquo;try on&rdquo; that sad face yourself without realizing you're doing so.In &ldquo;trying on&rdquo; your friend's expression，it helps you to recognize what they're feeling by connecting it with times in the past when you made that expression.Humans get this emotional meaning from facial expressions in a matter of only a few hundred milliseconds.</p><p>&ldquo;You reflect on your emotional feelings and then you produce some sort of recognition judgment，and the most important thing that results in is that you take the appropriate action&mdash;you approach the person or you avoid the person，&rdquo; Niedenthal says.&ldquo;Your own emotional reaction to the face changes your understanding of how you see the face in such a way that provides you with more information about what it means.&rdquo;</p><p>A person's ability to recognize and &ldquo;share&rdquo; others' emotions can be prevented when they can't mimic faces.This is a common complaint for people with motor diseases，like facial paralysis(瘫痪) from a stroke，or even due to nerve damage from plastic surgery.Niedenthal notes that the same would not be true for people who suffer paralysis from birth，because if you've never had the ability to mimic facial expressions，you will have developed another ways of interpreting emotions.Niedenthal next wants to explore what part in the brain is functioning to help with facial expression recognition.A better understanding of that part，she says，will give us a better idea of how to treat related disorders.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-11-04T14:39:40","decipherment":"这是一篇说明文。文章主要解释了人们是如何进行面部模仿的以及研究人员下一步的研究重点。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":null,"difficultyName":null,"gradeId":null,"id":"795179558767695747","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":2,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":3217533,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2022-11-04T06:58:31.060","uploadBatch":"1667543980503","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"ordered":12,"question":{"answer":"D","answerExplanation":"<p>上文提出，你可能需要多次阅读一个句子或段落，空处承接上文，应提到与之并列的一种情况，D选项中的&ldquo;the
