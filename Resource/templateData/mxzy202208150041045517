is no longer simply a platform for self-expression，gossip and networking，as it is becoming an increasingly fierce battlefield for businesses wanting to promote their products and services.</p><p>Over the year 2009，micro-blogging had become wildly popular in China，with some 65 million China based micro-blog accounts registered by the end of 2010 and the number is growing by more than 10 million each month，according to Data Center of the China Internet(DCCI)．</p><p>At present，China&rsquo;s largest web portal Sina claims to have 5,000 company micro-blog users，including Starbucks，Channel，and IKEA.On the micro-blog pages of the companies，visitors can not only view advertisements，but also see consumers&rsquo; feedback and even commentaries(评论) on hot social issues.</p><p>An Internet surfer nicknamed Xiaoben posted on his micro-blog page that he enjoyed drinking Puer tea，and within 10 minutes，a micro-blogger who owned an online shop selling Puer tea recommended his shop to Xiaoben.&ldquo;It is a little bit like magic.I just make a wish，and then I get a micro-blog response.&rdquo;</p><p>However，with more and more people micro-blogging to make money，experts warn that marketing via micro-blog could be a double-edged sword.Huang Heshui，professor from Xiamen University says micro-blogging is highly personal and private，and that too many advertising messages can annoy micro-blog users leading them to dislike certain brands.</p><p>Further，a brand can be as easily damaged as established through micro-blogging，as consumers&rsquo; negative feedback about a certain product or company can be very quickly spread in the micro-blog community，Huang added.</p><p>The micro-blog managers should set up some rules and regulations to supervise micro-blog marketing，and at the same time，business organizations need to strengthen self-discipline and try to build up an honesty-based business culture，an e-commerce expert Lu Bowang

spent on advertising is money spent as well as any I know of.It serves directly to bring about a rapid sale of goods at reasonable prices，setting up a firm home market and making it possible to provide for export at good prices.By drawing attention to new ideas it helps greatly to raise standards of living.By helping to increase demand it causes an increased need for labor，and is therefore a nice way to fight unemployment.It lowers the costs of many services：without advertisements your daily newspaper would cost four times as much，the price of your television program would need to be doubled，and travel by bus or subway would cost more.</p><p>And perhaps most important of all，advertising provides a promise of reasonable value in the products and services you buy.Besides the fact that twenty-seven Acts of Parliament govern the terms of advertising，no regular advertiser dare promote a product that fails to live up to the promise of his advertisements.He might fool some people for a little while through misleading advertising.He will not do so for long，for the public has the good sense not to buy the poor article more than once.If you see an article frequently advertised，it is the proof I know that the article does what is promised for it，and that it has good value.</p><p>Advertising does more for the good of the public than any other force I can think of.</p><p>There is one more point I feel I ought to touch on.Recently I heard a well-known television personality declare that he was against advertising because it persuades rather than informs.He was telling us the real difference.Of course advertising tries to persuade.</p><p>If its messages were nothing but information，that would be difficult to get more people to buy，for even a detail such as the choice of the color of a shirt is a bit persuasive&mdash;advertising would be so boring that no one would pay any attention.But perhaps that is what the well-known television personality
