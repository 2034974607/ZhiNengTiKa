our parents.However，when you start interacting with the outside world，you realize that they are not enough to ensure your success，not even your survival.It is the values passed on to you by your family such as patience，care，understanding and commitment that make your survival and growth possible.</p><p>You may or may not be aware，but your family was the first school you entered.&ldquo;Survival of the fittest&rdquo; is the golden rule in this world.In other words，&ldquo;Let the unfit perish&rdquo; is the motto.When you stepped into this world，you were unfit to survive on your own.From the first day you came into the world，you started learning about love，care and family relationships at home.For example，by observing your family members，you learned how family relationships work.As time went on，you matured and started taking note of other people outside your family and how your family members interacted with them.You also noticed how your family dealt with the ups and downs of life.</p><p>What you learned from your family becomes your value system and forms your perceptions and basis of actions.A person is known by his actions.It is your family that gave you an identity.Whenever you move from one place to another，you carry your family history with you.Have you ever noticed that your opinions always confirmed to the values you acquired from your family?</p><p>Every person&rsquo;s relation to his family is similar to the earth&rsquo;s relation to its environment，which acts as a protective layer.For a person，the importance of family is beyond calculation.The saying goes that you can choose your friends but you can&rsquo;t choose your family.Spend your life showing those you love that they will always be family no matter what
