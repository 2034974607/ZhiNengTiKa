who have good，supportive relationships with their teachers enjoy better health as adults，according to research published by an American research center.</p><p>&ldquo;This research suggests that improving students&rsquo; relationships with teachers could have positive and long-lasting effects beyond just academic success，&rdquo; said Jinho Kim，a professor at Korea University and author of the study.&ldquo;It could also bring about health <u>implications</u> in the long run.&rdquo;</p><p>Previous research has suggested that teens&rsquo; social relationships might be linked to health outcomes in adulthood.However，it is not clear whether the link between teen relationships and lifetime health is causal(因果的)&mdash;it could be that other factors，such as different family backgrounds，might contribute to both relationship problems in adolescence and to poor health in adulthood.Also，most research has focused on teens&rsquo; relationships with their peers(同龄人)，rather than on their relationships with teachers.</p><p>To explore those questions further，Kim analyzed data on nearly 20,000 participants from the Add Health study，a national study in the U．S.that followed participants from seventh grade into early adulthood.The participant pool included more than 3,400 pairs of siblings(兄弟姐妹)．As teens，participants answered questions，like &ldquo;How often have you had trouble getting along with other students and your teachers？&rdquo; As adults，participants were asked about their physical and mental health.</p><p>Kim found that participants who had reported better relationships with both their peers and teachers in middle and high school also reported better physical and mental health in their mid-20s.However，when he controlled for family background by looking at pairs of siblings together，only the link between good teacher relationships and adult health remained significant.</p><p>The results suggest teacher relationships are more important than previously realized and that schools should invest in training teachers on how to build warm and supportive relationships with their students.&ldquo;This is not something that most teachers receive much training in，&rdquo; Kim said，&ldquo;but it should be.&rdquo;</p><p><img src = 'https://img.xinjiaoyu.com/jby_files/prod/product_questions/6d598d35d62c48ff8e289d08c706e7081.png' width=\"583\"

help accomplish a specific goal.It&rsquo;s less useful to tell your friends that their dish tastes &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; than it is to suggest adding a little salt to improve the flavor.Feedback
