is recognized as a world leader in the development of artificial intelligence and facial recognition systems.A Chinese company，the Beijing-based Hanwang Technology Ltd.，says it has created a new facial recognition system that can identify people even if they are wearing masks.Engineers at the company say their system is the first to be created to effectively identify people wearing face masks.</p><p>The company told a news agency that a team of 20 people built the system in about a month.The system is based on existing technologies developed over the past 10 years.The process involved adding a collection of about 6 million unmasked faces and a much smaller collection of masked faces，the company said.</p><p>The company is now selling two main kinds of products that use the new technology.One performs &ldquo;single channel&rdquo; recognition，which is designed to be used at the entrances to buildings.The other product is a &ldquo;multi-channel&rdquo; recognition system that uses groups of surveillance(监视) cameras.It can identify individuals in a crowd of up to 30 people within a second.</p><p>&ldquo;When people are wearing a mask that covers the mouth and nose，the recognition rate can reach about 95%，which can ensure that most people can be identified，&rdquo; said Huang，vice-president of the company.He added that the system's success rate for people not wearing a mask is about 99.5%.However，the new system struggles to identify people wearing both a mask and sunglasses.&ldquo;In this situation，all of the key facial information is lost.In such cases recognition is tough，&rdquo; Huang said.</p><p>People were reacting differently to the new technology.While some citizens have been against using such tools，the majority have accepted the technology as an effective way to decrease crime and catch criminals.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-11-04T14:39:11","decipherment":"这是一篇说明文。文章主要介绍了一种新的面部识别系统，即使人们戴着口罩也可以识别。人们对这项技术持不同的态度。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":null,"difficultyName":null,"gradeId":null,"id":"795179437443258225","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":2,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":3217464,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2022-11-04T06:57:42.645","uploadBatch":"1667543951575","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"ordered":8,"question":{"answer":"C","answerExplanation":"<p>推理判断题。根据第一段最后一句可知，公众认为机器警犬是个危险的机器。故选C。</p>","cityId":null,"content":"<p>What

robotic police dog is being used to look for high body temperatures in homeless people at a temporary shelter in Hawaii's capital，Honolulu.The effort is one way public safety agencies are starting to use the commercial robot Spot.Spot can move like an animal and can walk over almost anything a person can.But people concerned about privacy warn that the police are quickly buying the robots without safeguards against misuse and that it may become a danger to people's privacy.</p><p>In Honolulu，the police department spent about $150,000 in federal pandemic(疫情)aid money to buy their Spot.It was bought from Boston Dynamics for use at a government homeless shelter near the airport to look for high body temperatures between mealtimes.Supervisor Joseph O'Neal of the Honolulu Police Department said，&ldquo;Because these people are houseless，it's considered OK to do that.&rdquo; The New York Police Department started using Spot after painting it blue and renaming it &ldquo;Digidog&rdquo;．However，Spot received attention and criticism that led the police department to return Digidog to its maker.</p><p>Michael Perry is the vice-president of Boston Dynamics.He said the company's usage guidelines <u>impede</u> the robot's use as a weapon.It is also not supposed to be used for anything that would go against privacy or civil rights laws.</p><p>There are about 500 Spot robots in use.Spot is still mostly controlled by humans.All the operators have to do is tell Spot which direction to go in and it can deal with a difficult path，like steps.It can also operate on its own，but only if it has memorized a path and there are not any surprises.Jongwook Kim，the legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii，said they are used by companies to inspect areas with dangerous levels of electricity and also used in building sites，mines and factories.Kim said that there might be some good uses for such machines but opening the door for police robots to work with the public is probably not a good idea.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-11-04T14:39:11","decipherment":"本文是一篇说明文。文章主要介绍了商用机器人Spot的优势与弊端。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":null,"difficultyName":null,"gradeId":null,"id":"795179437443258226","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":2,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":3217465,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2022-11-04T06:57:42.645","uploadBatch":"1667543951575","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"ordered":12,"question":{"answer":"A","answerExplanation":"<p>空前提到需要将经常使用的东西与行李分开放，以便容易取出来，空后提出然后开始打包它们，A项&ldquo;因此，首先列一张清单&rdquo;承上启下。故选A。</p>","cityId":null,"content":"","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-11-04T14:39:11","decipherment":null,"deleted":false,"difficultyId":"10018","difficultyName":"基础题","gradeId":null,"id":"795179437493589876","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":false,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":"So，make
