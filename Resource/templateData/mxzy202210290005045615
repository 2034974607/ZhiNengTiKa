on a new series of experiments，researchers now believe the slower a person's tendency to walk，the less able their brain.</p><p>Researchers performed gait(步态)-speed analysis on hundreds of middle-aged people，comparing the results with a range of physical and psychological measures.Doctors have long used walking speed to gain a quick and reliable understanding of older people's cognitive capability(认知能力)．Until now，however，no one knows it could mean potential brain health so much earlier in life.The <u>correlation</u> was so obvious that the US scientists now say walking tests could be used to provide an early indication of dementia(痴呆)．</p><p>The study showed an average difference of 16 IQ points between the slowest and the fastest walkers at the age of 45.This reflected both the participants' natural walking speed and the pace they achieved when asked to walk as fast as they could.</p><p>In the study，slower walkers were shown to have &ldquo;increasing aging&rdquo; on a 19-measure range designed by researchers，and their lungs and teeth tended to be in worse shape than the people who walked faster.</p><p>The team at Duke University in North Carolina said genetic factors may explain the link between walking speed，brain ability and physiological health，or that better brain health might promote physical activity，leading to better walking speed.</p><p>&ldquo;The thing that's really striking is that this is in 45-year-old people，not the older patients who are usually assessed with such measures，&rdquo; said Dr.Rasmussen，who led the research.The 904 New Zealand men and women who were tested at 45 were tracked from the age of three，each experiencing many tests over the years.The long-term data collection enabled researchers to find that little kids with lower IQ scores，language ability and ability to tolerate setbacks，tended to have slower gait speeds by middle age.</p><p>The researchers said some of the differences in health and cognition may be the result of lifestyle choices individuals have made.But the study also suggests that there are already signs in early life of who would become the slowest walkers.&ldquo;We may have a chance here to see who's going to do better health-wise in later life，&rdquo; said Dr.
