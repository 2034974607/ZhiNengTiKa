harming your brain.&rdquo; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re ruining your eyes.&rdquo; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re turning you into a violent person.&rdquo; The words said publicly against video games are so common，but are these worries founded on actual science? Countless studies have offered different opinions on whether video games are bad for you.We&rsquo;ve rounded up the most notable reports and studies below，so you can weigh up the evidence for yourself.</p><p>In 2013，psychologist Simone Kuhn studied the influences of spending long hours on video games on the brains of young adults and found that several areas became bigger than before.These areas are connected with higher cognitive functions(认知功能)，memory formation and fine motor(精细运动) function.</p><p>Last year，psychologists said that video game players who favour violent games are more likely to be violent when offline.Dr Mark Appelbaum of the American Psychological Association said that there was a relation between violent video game use and increases in violent behaviour.</p><p>Dr Daphne Bavelier is an expert in the field of Brain &amp; Cognitive Sciences.Bavelier presented the audience with a colour-word test，where non-gamers are easily puzzled by the test，and those who spend long periods playing on their computers are more likely to pass the test with flying colours.</p><p>&ldquo;Actually，those video game players have many other advantages in terms of attention，&rdquo; said Bavelier，&ldquo;and one part of attention which is also improved for the better is our ability to follow the movements of objects.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So，in a sense，when we think about the influence of video games on the brain，it&rsquo;s very similar to the influence of wine on the health.There are some very poor uses of wine.There are some very poor uses of video games.But when drunk in reasonable amounts，and at the right age，wine can be very good for health，&rdquo; said Bavelier.</p><p><img src =

you ever done something that was really dangerous just because you thought it was safe？Maybe you did a dangerous trick on your bicycle or skateboard because you were wearing a helmet and thought you couldn&rsquo;t get hurt.The psychology(心理) of this sort of behavior is called the Peltzman Effect，named after Sam Peltzman，professor of economics at the University of Chicago.Peltzman believes that those moments when people think they are the safest are the times when they act most dangerously.</p><p>Peltzman said that people drove more dangerously when they wore seat belts(安全带)．Driving a large four-wheel drive vehicle has a similar effect on drivers&rsquo; behavior.Because drivers of large vehicles sit up higher and can see better，they feel they can make better judgments when they drive.They are better protected in accidents，so they act more dangerously.This makes driving more <u>hazardous</u> to other drivers.</p><p>The Peltzman Effect isn&rsquo;t just limited to driving.In 1972，the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) passed a law requiring child safety caps on most medicine bottles.The safety caps were designed to prevent children from accidentally taking the medicine，especially painkillers such as aspirin.Requiring safety caps sounded like a great idea，but there was an unexpected side effect.Because the safety caps are so hard to take off，some people leave them off altogether.</p><p>Worse，some parents leave the bottles where kids can reach them because they feel that it is safe because of the cap.A study on the Peltzman Effect showed that more than 3,500 children have been harmed by aspirin because of the safety caps.</p><p>The Peltzman Effect describes how we&rsquo;re likely to take more risks and act more dangerously when we feel safest.What&rsquo;s more，the effects of these behaviors can be quite different from what we expect.</p><p><img src =
