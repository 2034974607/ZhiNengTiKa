science fiction type of entertainment is considered by most to be fathered by Jules Verne (<i>A</i> <i>Journey</i> <i>to</i> <i>the</i> <i>Center</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Earth</i> and <i>T</i><i>w</i><i>enty</i> <i>Thousand</i> <i>Leagues</i> <i>Under</i> <i>the</i> <i>Sea</i>) and H．G.Wells (<i>The</i> <i>Time</i> <i>Machine</i> and <i>The</i> <i>War</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Worlds</i>)．Sci-Fi，as it is commonly shortened，is a fictional story in which science and technology have a significant influence on the characters and plot.Many such works are guesswork about what the future holds and how scientific findings and technological advances will shape humankind.</p><p>Writing in the late 1800s，Jules Verne was remarkably successful in his 10 guesses about future technologies of air conditioning，automobiles，the Internet，television，and underwater，air，and space travel.Unbelievably，of all places from which to choose，Jules Verne guessed Tampa，Florida，USA as the launching site of the first project to the Moon，which was only 200 kilometers away from the actual 1969 location at Cape Canaveral，Florida.</p><p>One of the best-known science fiction books is <i>Nineteen</i> <i>Eighty</i>-<i>Four</i> by George Orwell.Published in 1949，it was not meant as a prediction，but as a warning：Orwell was describing what he saw as the outcome of the ideas，trends，and emerging technologies of his time.Many invented terms from this novel have become common in everyday use，such as &ldquo;big brother&rdquo; and &ldquo;doublethink&rdquo;．Even the author's name has been made into an adjective&mdash;Orwellian&mdash;and has become a warning descriptor for situations where privacy is lost and the individual has no power and is completely controlled by the government.<i>Nineteen</i> <i>Eighty</i>-<i>Four</i> was translated into sixty-five languages within five years of its publication，setting a record that still stands.</p><p>What helps bring science fiction into being is usually a new discovery or innovation.The author creates an analysis of the potential influence and consequences and then wraps it in a pleasant story.For example，the beginning of space exploration was followed a few years later by the <i>Star</i> <i>Trek</i> television program and movie series.The science fiction author's self-determined role is to search the world of future possibilities upon the road which we are traveling.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-11-04T14:38:26","decipherment":"本文是一篇说明文。文章讲述了过去的几部科幻小说对现在的预测和影响。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":null,"difficultyName":null,"gradeId":null,"id":"795179248011712341","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":3217336,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2022-11-04T14:38:26","uploadBatch":"1667543906413","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"ordered":12,"question":{"answer":"B","answerExplanation":"<p>文章下文是几条具体的建议，所以空处应首先提出以下是与医生面谈的几个小建议，B项符合题意，引出下文。故选B。</p>","cityId":null,"content":"","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-11-04T14:38:26","decipherment":null,"deleted":false,"difficultyId":"10019","difficultyName":"中档题","gradeId":null,"id":"795179248062043992","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":false,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":"This
