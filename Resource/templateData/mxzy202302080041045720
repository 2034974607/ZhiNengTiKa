had weather forecasts for years.Forecasting our near-term health is far harder.Yet knowing early that we may be coming down with the flu could be greatly helpful.Wearable technology，such as smart watches，is beginning to provide just such early warnings.</p><p>A research team asked 49 volunteers to wear wristbands with sensors before and after they received a cold or flu virus.At least once per second，their wristbands recorded heart rates，body movements，skin temperatures and more.In nine out of every ten participants，these data showed signs of developing illness at least a day before symptoms(症状) appeared.</p><p>This early warning can help stop infections(传染) in the beginning.It may head off serious symptoms that otherwise would send weak people into hospital，allowing them to get some rest，reduce their stress and perhaps take drugs.And knowing you&rsquo;re sick before you have symptoms can warn you to lay low so you can reduce the chance of spreading your disease.</p><p>However，these systems aren&rsquo;t yet ready for the real world.One challenge is that many viral infections have similar symptoms.In fact，many things other than viruses cause the same symptoms.Examples include food poisoning，asthma or seasonal allergies.Similarly，heart rates respond to things that have nothing to do with infections，such as exercise and scary movies.What&rsquo;s more，in real life，we don&rsquo;t know who was exposed(暴露)to some virus and when，so that post-exposure time window won&rsquo;t be known.Potentially infected people might be those whose data go beyond a certain value in any two-hour window.But the team has not yet tested how well the prediction model would work in this setting.</p><p>The study sounds exciting，but much work is left to do.Future systems will likely include other types of bodily changes that <u>pinpoint</u> developing illness.And researchers will be fine-tuning(微调) those systems by analyzing how well they predict effects in thousands of people.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2023-02-16T15:46:58","decipherment":"本文是一篇说明文，主要介绍的是可以预测身体健康状况的可穿戴设备。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":null,"difficultyName":null,"gradeId":null,"id":"832884831951000875","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":3711719,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2023-02-16T15:46:58","uploadBatch":"1676533618160","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"ordered":11,"question":{"answer":"B","answerExplanation":"<p>上文提到我们生活在对未来的假设中，且提到指引和资源能给我们带来工作、金钱、家庭和幸福，本句为本段最后一句，应承接上文说明这些指引和资源对未来生活的影响。故B项&ldquo;未来的生活似乎很有希望&rdquo;符合语境。</p>","cityId":null,"content":"","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2023-02-16T15:46:58","decipherment":null,"deleted":false,"difficultyId":"10019","difficultyName":"中档题","gradeId":null,"id":"832884831992943918","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":false,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":"The
