food into the microwave for a couple of minutes may seem harmless，and Europe&rsquo;s stock of these quick-cooking ovens give out as much carbon as nearly 7 million cars，a new study has found，and the problem is growing.With costs falling and kitchen appliances becoming frequently updated，owners are throwing many microwaves after an average of eight years.This is pushing sales of new microwaves which are expected to reach 135 million annually in the EU by the end of the decade.</p><p>A study by the University of Manchester worked out the emissions of carbon dioxide&mdash;the main greenhouse gas responsible for climate change&mdash;at every stage of microwaves，from production to waste disposal(处理)．&ldquo;It is electricity consumption by microwaves that has the biggest impact on the environment，&rdquo; say the authors，who also calculate that the emissions from using 19 microwaves over a year are the same as those from a car.&ldquo;According to the same study，efforts to reduce consumption should focus on improving consumer awareness and behaviour to use appliances more efficiently.For example，electricity consumption by microwaves can be reduced by adjusting the time of cooking to the type of food.&rdquo;</p><p>However，David Reay，professor of carbon management argues that，although microwaves use a great deal of energy，their emissions are minor compared to those from cars.In the UK alone，there are around 30 million cars.These cars emit more than all the emissions from microwaves in the EU.Backing this up，recent data show that passenger cars in the UK emitted 69 million tons of carbon dioxide in 2015.This is 10 times the amount this new microwave oven study estimates for annual emissions for all the microwave ovens in the whole of the EU.Further，the energy used by microwaves is lower than any other form of cooking.Among common kitchen appliances used for cooking，microwaves are the most energy efficient，followed by a stove and finally a standard oven.Thus，rising microwave sales could be seen as a positive thing.</p><p><img src = 'https://img.xinjiaoyu.com/jby_files/prod/product_questions/5b3dfe29278c4aeaa45050c65b2a89171.png' width=\"583\"

how harmful it is for all living beings.</p><p>In the future，Vivobarefoot hopes to increase their production of shoes created from sustainable materials，and thankfully，they are now one of many brands that aim to increase environmentalism and educate communities on how global warming affects everyone.</p><p>This year，they&rsquo;ll add more recyclable and traceable materials into more than half of their production line，and they have plenty of creative developments in the works as well.</p><p>The shoes also have a health benefit.Based on the concept that wider，minimally designed shoes enable our foot to function at maximum potential，wearers also experience better balance and sensory input.</p><p><img src =
