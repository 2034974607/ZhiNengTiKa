colleague recently sent me an article，<i>cutting</i> <i>back</i> <i>on</i> <i>w</i><i>aste</i> <i>is</i> <i>possible</i>&mdash;<i>if</i> <i>you</i> <i>can</i> <i>afford</i> <i>it</i>，to read.It argued that reducing waste&mdash;food related，in particular&mdash;is an expensive effort and a near impossibility for anyone working low-wage jobs with little extra time.The conclusion? Zero waste is something only suitable for people who can afford，not for those who are struggling to get by.</p><p>However，I take issue with the idea that zero waste must be all or nothing.I think this is an unfortunate mentality that prevents valuable progress toward reducing one&rsquo;s food-related waste.When we get too hung up on the idea of so-called zero waste and of being like the zero waste superstar Bea Johnson who can fit years of trash in a single jar，we start missing the broader point.The goal，after all，is to make smarter shopping decisions and establish practices that are sustainable(可持续的) for us，with our own unique resources and living situations.</p><p>I live in a small rural town with no fancy zero-waste stores.My husband and I both work full-time.I am uninterested in spending my free time doing DIY projects and driving from store to store in search of perfect packaging.Instead，I just do the best I can.</p><p>When I first read about Bea Johnson&rsquo;s multi-stop grocery shopping routine，I tried to copy it.That lasted a few weeks before I gave up.Unlike her，I still had babies to look after，and I did not live in San Francisco where stores are closer together than in rural Ontario.Instead，I&rsquo;ve resigned myself to the supermarket being the main supply of food and trying to work with it.</p><p>Now，when I enter the supermarket on a once-weekly basis，I view all packaging through a critical eye.I make constant comparisons between how one brand packages its food to another.That is the main factor in deciding what to buy，though I also consider
