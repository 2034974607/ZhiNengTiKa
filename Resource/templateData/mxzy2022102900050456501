like photography because it captures amazing things that you might not see again，&rdquo;Timmy Walsh says.He takes pictures of flowers，sunsets and road signs.But those photos don&rsquo;t usually end up in a scrapbook(剪贴簿) or on his bedroom walls.</p><p>When Timmy was five，he found out that his aunt Bev had lung cancer.He wanted to do something to help her.His first idea was to sell his photos from a lemonade-type stand in front of his house in Pennsylvania.&ldquo;My mom said it wouldn&rsquo;t work because we were not on a busy street，&rdquo; Timmy explains.</p><p>His next idea was to have an art show.Timmy decorated his home with candles，flowers，and white lights.Then he arranged his photos.Timmy&rsquo;s mom，Sheila，remembers：&ldquo;Our dining-room table was filled，the living room&mdash;everything was filled with photos.&rdquo;Friends，family，and Timmy&rsquo;s teachers came to the show.He raised more than $300 for cancer research that night.Aunt Bev was &ldquo;very happy and excited，&rdquo; he says.</p><p>After a local newspaper wrote a story about Timmy&rsquo;s photos，a volunteer offered to help him set up a website.As people learned about his cause，called Camera for a Cure，Timmy began receiving invitations to sell his pictures at art galleries and fund-raisers.Since then，his work has appeared in more than 20 shows.</p><p>When Timmy is at a show，he greets each customer and talks about what he was thinking when he took his photos.And he always shares facts about lung cancer.Sometimes donations and sales are slow，but that doesn&rsquo;t bother him.&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter how much money we made because we just raised awareness，&rdquo; he says.Timmy knows that finding a cure for lung cancer will take time and effort.So Timmy will keep doing his part

called The Blind Spot.This exhibition was accessible to the visually disabled.Sighted visitors are encouraged to wear a blindfold on their eyes as they experience the artworks.This exhibition excited the other senses other than the visual sense.Visitors could look at artworks as expected.Besides，they could also touch and smell them.The show was designed to provide a better experience for museumgoers with poor eyesight.</p><p>The Blind Spot recreated existing famous paintings，but with extra dimensions，such as sound and smell.Visitors could even get a &ldquo;feel&rdquo; for the art，which included touchable elements.</p><p>Visitor Farid el Manssouri seemed to enjoy his experience.He smiled as he moved his hands over cheese，grapes and bread，part of the representation of a famous 1610 painting by Floris van Dvck.&ldquo;The first thing that struck me was the smell.I could really smell the fragrant cheese，and I touched it too，&rdquo; Manssouri said.Manssouri wondered how the food did not fall from its unbalanced position.&ldquo;That was really surprising to feel...I guess it was glued on pretty well，&rdquo; Manssouri said.</p><p>Artist Jasper Udink ten Cate and designer Jeroen Prins created The Blind Spot.They said they were inspired by an experience they shared with a blind visitor at an art show one year ago.&ldquo;One day，somebody who could not see was there.At the place we served food out of this work，and we helped her touch the artwork.She was blind but she had a lot of feelings.She was touched.So we had the realization，&rsquo;Wow，we have something.&rsquo; That moment was the starting point to actually create this exhibition，&rdquo; ten Cate said.</p><p>The museum&rsquo;s head Steffie Maas said The Blind Spot was an impressive

the task，and can also pass skills on through several generations.</p><p>The findings add to the evidence suggesting the ability for &ldquo;culture spread&rdquo;&mdash;the ability to learn and pass on knowledge and skills&mdash;may not be <u>exclusive</u><u>&nbsp;</u>to humans.</p><p>In the research，published in the journal <i>PLOS</i> <i>Biology</i> on Tuesday，the scientists were able to train 23 out of a group of 40 bees to pull strings with their legs and feet.</p><p>The strings were attached to discs&mdash;or artificial &ldquo;flowers&rdquo;&mdash;containing food at their center but placed under a transparent(透明的) screen.The bees，spotting the food beneath the screen，learned to pull the &ldquo;flowers&rdquo; out by pulling the string with their legs and feet to be able to get to it.</p><p>From another group of bees given the chance to solve the task without any training，only two of 110 were successful.</p><p>Another group of bees was then allowed to observe the trained bees pulling the strings，and 60 percent of them successfully learned the skill.Finally，trained bees were put in colonies，and the scientists found the technique spread successfully to a majority of the colony&rsquo;s worker bees.</p><p>Lars Chittka，a Queen Mary University professor who guided the project，said the team is interested in figuring out the brain processes behind the bees&rsquo; learning
