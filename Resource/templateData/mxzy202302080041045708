bad outcomes.He said，&ldquo;Smiling for the sake of smiling can lead to emotional tiredness，and that&rsquo;s bad for the organization.&rdquo; He also said the research showed customer-service workers who had &ldquo;fake smiles&rdquo; throughout the day didn&rsquo;t want to work，so their productivity dropped.</p><p>The study is one of the first of its kind to examine emotional expressions over a period of time and compare the different effects on men and women.Dr Scott&rsquo;s team examined the effects of &ldquo;surface acting&rdquo;，or fake smiling，compared to &ldquo;deep acting&rdquo;，or making people smile by thinking of pleasant memories.</p><p>Dr Scott said，&ldquo;Women were harmed more by surface acting，meaning their moods worsened even more than men&rsquo;s.However，they were helped more by deep acting，which meant their moods improved more by thinking of pleasant memories.&rdquo;</p><p>According to Dr Scott，women tend to suffer more when pretending to be happy because they are expected to be more emotionally expressive than men.Therefore，forcing a smile while feeling down is more likely to go against their normal behavior and cause more harmful feelings.</p><p>Although deep acting can improve moods a little in the short term，Dr Scott says it&rsquo;s not a long-term solution to feeling unhappy.There have been some suggestions that if you do this over a long period you start to feel unreal.You&rsquo;re trying to develop positive emotions，but at the end of the day you may not feel like yourself any
