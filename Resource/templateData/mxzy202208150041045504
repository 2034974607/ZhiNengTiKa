is widely believed that humour is good for your health.However，most studies on humour and health show that by watching something humorous&mdash;comedy films，for example&mdash;you can just escape from the pain for a short time，or that humour just helps reduce signs of a disease.So far，no study has shown that humour can help a person recover from a serious illness.</p><p>One way to study the relationship between humour and health is looking at the health of people who use humour as part of their jobs：comedians and improv(即兴表演) artists，for example.Not only do they use humour as part of their work，but also they show the highest levels of humour ability.So if humour is really good for our health，we can <u>anticipate</u> that comedians benefit the most from it.</p><p>Although it is often said that humour can make people live longer，research has actually found the opposite to be true.One study found that comedians and humour writers actually died younger compared with other famous people who were not performers.However，these studies were somewhat limited，because most of the comedians were men and already dead.And many famous people often lived very unhealthy lives，and the comedians might have died from reasons such as heavy drinking or smoking.</p><p>My colleagues and I decided to take a different way.We collected data(数据) from 491 improv artist students&mdash;224 women and 267 men&mdash;all alive.We compared this improv group with 795 noncomedians，who were matched in age，sex，and education.</p><p>We asked participants from both groups to tell us how many diseases they had had in the past three years and how long they had lasted.The improv artists reported that they had had many more diseases，and that these diseases had lasted longer compared with the control group.So our study adds further evidence to the conclusion made by the studies before.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-09-18T14:27:39","decipherment":"本文是一篇说明文。文章主要讲了人们普遍认为幽默对我们的健康有益，但研究发现，幽默对我们健康的益处并没有那么大。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":null,"difficultyName":null,"gradeId":null,"id":"778144303514915878","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":2830577,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2022-09-18T14:27:39","uploadBatch":"1663482459140","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":{"answer":"C","answerSheetExtId":"785107495969518447","answerSheetId":"785107495692694383","createBy":"0","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-10-07T11:36:53","deleted":false,"finishTime":"2022-10-07T11:36:54","homeworkId":"864560","id":"785107496250537667","isCorrect":true,"isExplain":false,"isReviewed":true,"isSubjective":false,"maxScore":2,"oldId":null,"questionId":"778144303565247529","questionNumber":"Ⅳ-1","rawScan":null,"reviewedScan":null,"schoolId":"100117","score":2.00,"scoreArea":null,"studentId":"196209","teacherId":"34053","templateId":"118902","updateBy":null,"updateName":null,"updateTime":"2022-10-07T11:36:53"},"answerStatus":1,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":true,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"ordered":6,"question":{"answer":"C","answerExplanation":"<p>根据下文&ldquo;Jamaria&rsquo;s
