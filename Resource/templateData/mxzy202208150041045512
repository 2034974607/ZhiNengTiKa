you are fond of learning languages，you must start learning Chinese.English is the most widely spoken language in the world and it is a more powerful language in all fields.But it is expected that Chinese，which is one of the six official languages of the United Nations (UN)，will be the most important language in the coming years.What are the reasons behind the rapid spread of this language and why should you learn it?</p><p>My desire to learn languages was the reason why I studied many Latin languages and in the process，I deepened my knowledge of the languages and literature.However，I did not feel self-sufficient(自给自足的) from this knowledge.I gained a lot of information about the Western world.But my thinking was always about Asian civilizations.I always felt I needed to learn Chinese to be a global citizen(全球公民) because &ldquo;without learning Chinese，we see with one eye&rdquo;．</p><p>My contact with many international organizations and government institutions(机构) made me believe that Chinese is one of the most important languages of our time.After visiting the world&rsquo;s most celebrated capitals such as Paris and London，I discovered that Chinese language can be seen everywhere in these places.In the subway in Paris，you can hear instructions in French，English and Chinese.In London，for example，the Chinese language was introduced for instruction in schools.</p><p>China is an important political(政治的) and economic country because it is making great economic progress that has never been seen before.The world is watching China with great surprise，and this peaceful Chinese rise makes us decide to focus on learning Chinese language and knowing more about Chinese culture.</p><p>To be a global citizen these days，I would advise you to learn Chinese.It will add more beauty to your life and allow you to better understand Chinese civilization.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-09-18T14:30:19","decipherment":"本文是一篇说明文。随着中国经济的崛起，汉语在世界上起着越来越重要的作用，你一定要去学的语言就是&ldquo;汉语&rdquo;。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":null,"difficultyName":null,"gradeId":null,"id":"778144975387890785","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":2830787,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2022-09-18T14:30:19","uploadBatch":"1663482619347","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":false,"isGroupQuestion":false,"isMistake":false,"ordered":11,"question":{"answer":"<p>1．an　2．on　3．What　4．thrilling　5．which　6．has
