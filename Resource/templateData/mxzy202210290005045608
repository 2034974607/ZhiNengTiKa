no secret that literature is powerful.For many of us，there have been times in our lives&mdash;a loved one's passing，our first heartbreak&mdash;that we couldn't have made it through without a few extraordinary books，poems，or perhaps even just a few words strung together.We knew the connective power of literature all along，but now there's science behind it.</p><p>A number of studies have shown that poetry provides a number of benefits for patients suffering from chronic(慢性的) and terminal(晚期的) illnesses.A randomized clinical trial，which set out to &ldquo;evaluate the effect of passive listening to music and poetry on the variation in pain，depression，and hope scores&rdquo; of 75 adult patients，came back with fascinating results.Researchers discovered that music and poetry both lessened pain intensity and depression，but only poetry increased hope scores.</p><p>After listening to poems，one participant said，&ldquo;I feel calmer when I hear those words.Sadness passes.They are important words; they show me that I'm not alone.&rdquo; What is it about those words that gives them the power to keep sadness away，and，moreover，to bring peace and comfort? As reported in <i>Nautilus</i>，&ldquo;Poetry has a structure，which is something we can experience with our bodies.&rdquo;</p><p>Using something called functional magnetic resonance imaging，researchers were able to ascertain that the recitation of poetry engages the mesolimbic pathway(中脑边缘系统通路)，the primary reward circuitry in the brain.While poetry won't cure the disease，it can help patients deal with the pain，both physical and emotional，associated with the illness.Treatment is important，but what physicians tend to forget is that healing(康复) is equally crucial for successful recovery.And healing is not just a matter of the body，but one of the mind and spirit，too.</p><p>In the context of terminal illness，communication between patient and physician extends beyond mere descriptions of physical pain，and transcends(超越) to more personal，and even more difficult to express conditions，such as mood，morale，and tiredness.Through poetry，doctors are able to better understand the mental state of their patients and as a result，better aid patients in the healing or treatment process.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-11-04T14:37:38","decipherment":"本文是一篇说明文。文章主要介绍了诗歌对病人的心理和精神的疗愈作用。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":null,"difficultyName":null,"gradeId":null,"id":"795179045741401912","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":3217224,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2022-11-04T14:37:38","uploadBatch":"1667543858190","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"ordered":7,"question":{"answer":"B","answerExplanation":"<p>细节理解题。根据第二段倒数第二句&ldquo;She

Brooks was the first African American to win a Pulitzer Prize for Literature.Gwendolyn Brooks wrote hundreds of poems during her lifetime.She was known around the world for using poetry to increase understanding about black culture in America.</p><p>Her poems described conditions among the poor，racial inequality and drug use in the black community.She also wrote poems about the struggles of black women.But her skill was more than her ability to write about struggling black people.She was an expert at the language of poetry.She combined traditional European poetry styles with the African American experience.</p><p>In her early poetry，Gwendolyn Brooks wrote about the South Side of Chicago.The South Side of Chicago is where many black people live.In her poems，the South Side is called Bronzeville.It was <i>A</i> <i>Street</i> <i>in</i> <i>Bronze</i><i>v</i><i>ille</i> that gained the attention of literary experts in 1945.Critics praised her poetic skill and her powerful descriptions of the black experience during the time.The Bronzeville poems were her first published collection.</p><p>In 1950，Gwendolyn Brooks became the first African American to win the Pulitzer Prize for Literature.She won the prize for her second book of poems called <i>Annie</i> <i>Allen</i>.<i>Annie</i> <i>Allen</i> is a collection of poetry about the life of a Bronzeville girl as a daughter，wife and mother.She experiences loneliness，loss，death and being poor.Ms Brooks said that winning the prize changed her life.</p><p>Her next work was a novel written in 1953 called <i>Maud</i> <i>Martha</i>.<i>Maud</i> <i>Martha</i> received little notice when it was first published.But now it is considered an important work by some critics.Its main ideas about the difficult life of many women are popular among female writers today.</p><p>In some of her poems，Gwendolyn Brooks described how what people see in life is affected by who they are.One example is this poem，<i>Corners</i> <i>on</i> <i>the</i> <i>Cur</i><i>v</i><i>ing</i> <i>Sky</i>.</p><p>By the end of the 1960s，Gwendolyn Brooks's poetry expanded from the everyday experiences of people in Bronzeville.She wrote about a wider world and dealt with important political issues.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-11-04T14:37:38","decipherment":"本文主要介绍了著名女诗人格温德林&middot;布鲁克斯的诗歌成就及作品特点。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":null,"difficultyName":null,"gradeId":null,"id":"795179045741401913","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":3217225,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2022-11-04T14:37:38","uploadBatch":"1667543858190","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"ordered":11,"question":{"answer":"D","answerExplanation":"<p>上文讲学生在阅读古典文学作品时会抱怨，下文转而讲阅读古典著作有充足的理由，可推知空处应与学生不理解阅读古典文学的目的和理由相关，D选项切题。故选D。</p>","cityId":null,"content":"","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-11-04T14:37:38","decipherment":null,"deleted":false,"difficultyId":"10018","difficultyName":"基础题","gradeId":null,"id":"795179045787539258","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":false,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":"Clearly，that's

</b><b>Case</b><b> </b><b>for</b><b> </b><b>Classics</b></p><p>Many high schoolers complain when they look at a course syllabus(大纲) for Chinese and see literary assignments that include <i>The</i> <i>Story</i> <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>Stone</i> and other pieces of classic literature. <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>1</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> But there are some good reasons why reading the classics is an important part of a 21st century education.</p><p><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>2</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> As students explore texts that were written hundreds of years before，they peer through a window into the world as it was in those days.Being able to hear those voices from the past is a privilege young people should be grateful to have.</p><p>Furthermore，as students examine classic works，they begin to see the fabric of history from a different perspective.Absorbed with their own daily activities，most teens rarely think about the fact that human civilization has been around for a long time. <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>3</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> The experiences and perspectives of those people can provide important insights into the challenges that teenagers face today.The wording and style may have changed，but the underlying themes that stir the heart，including love，loss，courage，revolution，and humor，are as true today as they were for the authors of these early works.</p><p>One of the most important reasons to study classic literature，however，is to expand one's mind.<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>4</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> To illustrate this，a group of scientists gathered volunteers who agreed to have their brains scanned while reading phrases from classic literature in both their original form and in modern translations.The result of the study showed a significant increase in the brain activity of people reading the original texts.</p><p><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>5</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> It connects students to the history and values of the broader human community.It challenges their minds with the ideas and words of people who came before them.Therefore，if today's teens are going to grow as readers，writers，and critical thinkers，it is essential that classic literature remains a
