riding has taken the world by storm.Bicycles are typically made of steel or aluminum(铝) but now there is a unique company that is growing bikes on trees.</p><p>These bicycles are made of British-grown ash trees(白蜡树) by Welsh furniture maker Andy Dix.His company，Twmpa Frames，is making bikes that are both high performance and environmentally sustainable.Going from furniture to bicycles came about after a conversation with author Rob Penn.Penn was looking for craftsmen to make things from an ash tree that fell for his book: <i>The</i> <i>Man</i> <i>Who</i> <i>Made</i> <i>Things</i> <i>Out</i> <i>of</i> <i>Trees</i>.</p><p>&ldquo;We talked about what I might build，and I suggested a bike，&rdquo; said Dix.&ldquo;It seemed like a good fit，but actually I had no experience in bike building，and Rob had a publishing deadline.In the end，I built him a writing desk instead.&rdquo; But the idea interested Dix who decided that he had to make it happen just to see if he could.</p><p>It took two years to build the prototype(原型) that was made from ash wood.Dix tested the wooden bike on the roughest roads he could find and discovered that it was comfortable，and excellent at absorbing vibrations(振动)．He put more than 3,000 miles on the bike.While cutting down trees can add to more carbon in the atmosphere，sustainable tree farming is possible.Sustainable forestry is about balancing the needs of the environment and forest communities through limiting harvests and replanting trees.</p><p>Producing a ton of aluminum in Britain results in carbon emissions of 4,532kg while producing a ton of wood only results in 457kg.Making bicycle frames out of wood won&rsquo;t make a huge difference but it is a small roll in the right direction.</p><p>The cost of a new Twmpa Cycle is out of reach for many bicycle riders; the idea of using sustainable materials like ash could start a new cycling revolution that puts the environment first.The company is even making plans to produce a wooden e-bike.Helping the environment could be just a pedal away.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2023-02-16T15:46:29","decipherment":"这是一篇说明文。威尔士家具制造商安迪&middot;迪克斯使用英国种植的白蜡树制造自行车，这将会减少环境污染，对环境保护有着非常重要的意义。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":null,"difficultyName":null,"gradeId":null,"id":"832884710291019151","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":3711593,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2023-02-16T15:46:29","uploadBatch":"1676533589154","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"ordered":11,"question":{"answer":"C","answerExplanation":"<p>根据上文&ldquo;The
