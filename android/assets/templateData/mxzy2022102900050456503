is a branch of regenerative(再生的) medicine currently under development.It is a biological cousin of 3D printing，a technique that piles layers of material on top of each other to construct a three-dimensional object.Instead of starting with metal or plastic，a 3D printer for organs and tissues uses bioink.The main part of many bioinks are water-rich molecules(分子) called hydrogels.Mixed into those are millions of living cells as well as various chemicals that encourage cells to communicate and grow.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s say you want to print a meniscus(半月板)，which is made up of cells called chondrocytes(软骨细胞)．First，you will need a healthy supply of them for your bioink.Then，bioink gets loaded into a printing chamber and pushed through a round nozzle(喷嘴)，it comes out from the nozzle and can produce a continuous filament(细丝) roughly the thickness of a human fingernail.A computerized image or file guides the placement，either onto a flat surface or into a liquid bath that&rsquo;ll help hold the structure in place until it stabilizes.After printing，some bioinks will harden immediately，others need UV light or an additional chemical or physical process to stabilize the structure.</p><p>If the printing process is successful，the cells in the tissue will begin to behave the same way cells do in real tissue：Signaling to each other，exchanging nutrients，and multiplying.We can already print relatively simple structure like this meniscus.However，replicating the complex biochemical environment of a major organ is a steep challenge.One of the biggest challenges is how to supply oxygen and nutrients to all the cells in a full-size organ.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why researchers are busy developing ways to incorporate blood vessels into bioprinted tissue.There&rsquo;s huge potential to use bioprinting to save lives.And the technology opens up a lot of possibilities.Could we one day engineer organs that surpass current human capability，or give ourselves features like unburnable skin?</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-11-04T14:39:53","decipherment":"本文是一篇说明文。文章主要介绍了生物打印人体器官技术。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":null,"difficultyName":null,"gradeId":null,"id":"795179613998290828","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":4,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":3217573,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2022-11-04T07:02:55.613","uploadBatch":"1667543993629","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"ordered":36,"question":{"answer":"B","answerExplanation":"<p>根据上文可知，问题的发生是由一系列的事情导致的；B项中的&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
