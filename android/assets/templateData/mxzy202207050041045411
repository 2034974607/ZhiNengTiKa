married Franklin Pierce Adams，and they set off for Latin America，where they covered 40,000 miles on a horse，by boat and on foot.When they returned nearly three years later，she gave a lecture at <i>National</i> <i>Geographic</i> and started a 30-year career as a contributor.</p><p>Adams made it her mission to visit every country that was or had been a Spanish colony，and revisited the places where Christopher Columbus had stayed from Europe to the Americas.She traveled around Asia and attended Haile Selassie&rsquo;s Coronation(加冕礼) as the emperor of Ethiopia.During World War Ⅰ，she was the first female journalist allowed to photograph the French trenches(战壕)，where she stayed for months.</p><p>She wrote 21 articles detailing her experiences for <i>National</i> <i>Geographic</i>，more than

I could hardly find them，&rdquo; she wrote after a visit to Peru.&ldquo;What have they not suffered under the control of the Europeans？&rdquo;</p><p>Adams had no professional training as a geographer and had never been to college，but her color photo slides and adventurous travel style won her invitations to speak around the world，often from the organizations that had never invited a woman in before.She was the third American woman asked to join the Royal Geographical Society in England.However，the New York-based Explorers Club gave her and other outstanding female adventurers the cold shoulder.</p><p>&ldquo;Men have always been so afraid that some mere woman might get into their discussion that they don&rsquo;t even permit women in their clubhouses，&rdquo; Adams once said，&ldquo;let alone allow them to attend any meetings for discussions that might be significantly helpful.&rdquo;</p><p>Several female explorers decided to form their own club.In 1925，the Society of

people&rsquo;s career expectations have become more concentrated in fewer occupations(职业) over the past two decades though social media and technologies like Artificial Intelligence(AI) are developing rapidly，according to a report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development(OECD)．Traditional occupations from the 19th and 20th centuries，such as lawyers and police officers，continue to trap(使陷入) the imaginations of young people around the world as they did nearly 20 years ago.</p><p>The report，based on a latest survey of the 15-year-olds in 41 countries，said the career expectations of youngsters may be &ldquo;<u>antiquated</u> and unrealistic&rdquo;．Nearly half of young people around the world wish to work in just 10 of the most common professions.The surveys show that too many teenagers are ignoring，or don&rsquo;t know，new types of jobs that are coming up，particularly as a result of digitalisation(数字化)．It is a concern that more young people than before appear to be picking their dream job from a small list of the most popular，traditional occupations，like teachers，lawyers or business managers.</p><p>The report found that among boys and girls who perform similarly in science，boys are more likely to expect to work in science and engineering.The top 10 occupations preferred by boys have changed very little since 2000，but girls are now more likely to want to be architects，police officers，and designers rather than hairdressers or writers.</p><p>The report also found a broader range of career expectations in countries with strong and firm occupational training for teenagers.For example，in Germany teenagers show a much wider range of career interests that better reflect patterns of labour market demands.More than a third of students in the UK report a lack of career advice at schools and colleges.Young people&rsquo;s wishes are set as young as age seven，and do not change enough over time to meet demands.</p><p><img src =
