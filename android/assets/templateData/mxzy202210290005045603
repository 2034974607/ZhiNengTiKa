this phenomenon，I believe it is necessary to consider giving robots certain rights humans enjoy.</p><p>Experts have argued it's appropriate to consider if they should have human rights.Sophia has a humanlike face and use artificial intelligence to respond to speech and express emotions.Does it not deserve the right to be loved and respected? In 2014，a Canadian robot，hitchBOT had his head cut off while hitch-hiking in the United States，causing a massive grief from the public.This will therefore set us on the path to consider ethical issues concerning robots.</p><p>A more persuasive reason for <u>this</u> is the protection of social values.We should certainly stop a young child from kicking or tearing a toy robot apart not that it is an expensive toy but，more importantly that the robot resembles a real life.Allowing the abuse of such a robot may lead a child to think that abusing a live pet such as a dog is acceptable.Giving robots certain rights will ensure that social standards are set and keep children，and even adults，from engaging in undesirable behavior.</p><p>Still，many have strongly argued that robots are not flesh and blood，unlike human beings；however complicated they may be，they are still machines.It is therefore ridiculous to treat them as living beings.While there is some truth，with advances in technology，it is a matter of time before sentient robots become a reality and we would have to consider granting them rights.</p><p>In conclusion，deciding whether robots deserve human rights is by no means an easy task，but now is the time to seriously consider the possibility and our moral and legal obligations towards them since it is not ethical to deny rights and protection to sentient beings or loved ones.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-11-04T14:36:54","decipherment":"这是一篇议论文。人们越来越愿意将机器人视为不仅仅是金属和塑料，而是像伙伴、朋友甚至孩子一样的人类，故本文作者论述了应该赋予机器人人权的几个理由。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":null,"difficultyName":null,"gradeId":null,"id":"795178862706169620","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":2,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":3217073,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2022-11-04T06:51:57.246","uploadBatch":"1667543814551","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"ordered":11,"question":{"answer":"F","answerExplanation":"<p>上文指出，在开始新工作之前一定要了解清楚，并提供了两个可以问的对象，选项F承接上文，说明如果不确定去问哪个人，可以向招聘你的人核实，符合语境。故选F。</p>","cityId":null,"content":"","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-11-04T14:36:54","decipherment":null,"deleted":false,"difficultyId":"10018","difficultyName":"基础题","gradeId":null,"id":"795178862752306968","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":false,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":"Ask
