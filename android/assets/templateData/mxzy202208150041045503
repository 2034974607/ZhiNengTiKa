kids help out around the house with chores such as emptying the dishwasher，putting laundry away，and taking out the trash.In exchange，some kids get allowances or other rewards such as extra computer time.</p><p>But some people do not think that kids should get rewards for doing chores.Susie Walton，a parenting educator and family coach，believes that by rewarding kids，parents are sending a message that work isn&rsquo;t worth doing unless you get something in return.&ldquo;Running any kind of household is a team effort，&rdquo; Susie said.&ldquo;A home is a living space for everyone in the family.It&rsquo;s important for kids to see that we all have responsibilities in the house，and that families decide together how they want their home to look，and how they are going to keep it looking like everyone wants it to look.&rdquo;</p><p>Other people believe that getting a cash allowance or other rewards can motivate kids to do chores，and it can also teach them real world lessons about how we need to work to earn money.There are also new applications that give kids points and digital gifts that can be redeemed(兑取) either online or in the real world.With the ChoreMonster app，kids earn digital points by completing chores that they can turn in for real-life rewards such as extra Xbox time or a trip to the mall.&ldquo;Our goal is to encourage kids to earn rewards，&rdquo; says Chris Bergman，founder of ChoreMonster.&ldquo;Kids need positive reinforcement to help motivate them.&rdquo;</p><p>What do you think?
