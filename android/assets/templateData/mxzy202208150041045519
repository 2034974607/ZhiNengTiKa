recent years，scientists have found a surprising phenomenon：In many cultures around the world，parents don&rsquo;t struggle to raise helpful，kind kids.From ages 2 to 18，kids want to help their families.They wake up in the morning，voluntarily do the dishes，hop off their bikes to help their dad carry groceries into the house and when somebody hands them a cake，they share it with a younger sister or brother before taking a bite themselves.You can find these <u>charitable</u> kids among farmers，hunters and fishermen.</p><p>During the past four years，I&rsquo;ve been interested in learning what are these parents doing to nurture such helpfulness in their kids.While doing the research，I traveled to three of the world&rsquo;s most honored cultures&mdash;the Maya，Inuit and Hadzabe，and described what I found in my new book&mdash;<i>Hunt</i>，<i>Gather</i>，<i>Parent</i>.</p><p>Supported by psychologists，my research result shows that parents raising helpful children welcome young children and babies into family chores and work&mdash;even if the child will make a bit of a mess or slow down the work，just opposite to many of American parents.What they say is that，&ldquo;I know they are not going to do a good job，but to create more work for me.&rdquo; In fact，turning down help from kids can have a bad influence，destroying their desire to help and possibly stop their desire to take care of their families.</p><p>&ldquo;Given request at an early age，the children would start to act on what&rsquo;s needed，and then the less likely parents need to be telling them what to do later，&rdquo; Lew-Levy，a psychologist in Harvard University，says.&ldquo;You can pull back on the teaching，and kids just do it on their own.&rdquo; But how does a parent let a young baby help with a task they can&rsquo;t actually do yet&mdash;especially a task that may be too dangerous for them? You can find specific instructions in the following chapter.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-09-18T14:33:01","decipherment":"本文是一篇说明文。文章介绍了在某些文化中，孩子都乐于助人，作者就其原因进行了调查和分析。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":null,"difficultyName":null,"gradeId":null,"id":"778145656672883862","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":2830970,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2022-09-18T14:33:01","uploadBatch":"1663482781778","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":false,"isGroupQuestion":false,"isMistake":false,"ordered":11,"question":{"answer":"<p>1．expectations　2．original　3．acceptable　4．adapted　5．who/that　6．to do　7．involved　8．it　9．unsatisfied　10．Despite</p>","answerExplanation":"<p>1．考查名词。该空作have的宾语，且表示复数意义，用名词复数。故填expectations。</p><p>2．考查名词。该空作to的宾语，用名词，此处特指一部电影的原稿，应用单数。故填original。</p><p>3．考查形容词。分析可知，此处应用形容词短语acceptable to&ldquo;可接受的，令&hellip;&hellip;满意的&rdquo;作后置定语，修饰名词actors。故填acceptable。</p><p>4．考查非谓语动词。此处指书被改编，表示被动意义，用adapt的过去分词。故填adapted。</p><p>5．考查强调句。若把It is和该空去掉，该句结构完整，语意清晰，由此判断该句为强调句。强调句的基本结构是：It is/was＋被强调部分＋that/who＋句子的其他成分，如果被强调的部分是人，也可以用who代替that，这里强调the book writer。故填who/that。</p><p>6．考查非谓语动词。该空为不定式作抽象名词position的后置定语，in the position to do sth.&ldquo;能够做某事&rdquo;。故填to do。</p><p>7．考查语态。be involved in&ldquo;参与，包括在&hellip;&hellip;中&rdquo;，该短语是固定短语。故填involved。</p><p>8．考查代词。分析句子结构，不定式&ldquo;to adapt to a new form&rdquo;是真正的宾语，置于句末，前面需要使用形式宾语it。故填it。</p><p>9．考查词性转换。be unsatisfied with&ldquo;对&hellip;&hellip;不满意&rdquo;，该短语是固定短语。故填unsatisfied。</p><p>10．考查介词。句意为：尽管有这些挑战，还是有一些根据畅销书改编的非常成功的电影。the challenges是名词短语，前面需要介词，且表示&ldquo;尽管&rdquo;。故填Despite。</p>","cityId":null,"content":"<p>语法填空</p><p>Reading a book and watching a film are two very different experiences，but it&rsquo;s normal to have high 1.<u>      </u>(expect) when a film of a favourite book is made.Most audiences and critics have been pessimistic or even disappointed by a film of a book they love.</p><p>A key question is obviously how close to the 2.<u>        </u>(origin) the film is.Another problem area is the cast.Finding actors 3.<u>        </u>(accept) to film audiences can mean the difference between success and failure.Some books are just too difficult to be 4.<u>        </u>(adapt) for technical reasons.Technology has had a huge impact on the film industry.It is the book writer 5.<u>       </u> is in the best position 6.<u>     </u>(do) film adaptations.In fact，sometimes authors are 7.<u>     </u>(involve) in the process eagerly and may even be the screenwriter.They may be too close to the material and find 8.<u>    </u><u>              </u><u>    </u> difficult to adapt to a new form.Sometimes writers have been very 9.<u>   </u><u>            </u><u>     </u>(satisfy) with the film versions of their work.Anyway，it is always a bad idea to watch a film of a book you love.</p><p>10．<u>        </u> the challenges，there have been some highly successful films made from popular books.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-09-18T14:33:01","decipherment":"这是一篇说明文。文章主要讲述了把一本畅销书改编成电影，有很多制约因素。尽管有这些挑战存在，还是有一些电影根据畅销书改编得非常成功。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":"10019","difficultyName":"中档题","gradeId":null,"id":"778145656677078165","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":false,"isSubjective":true,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":2830971,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"5","typeDetailName":"填空题","typeId":"15","typeName":"语法填空","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2022-09-18T14:33:01","uploadBatch":"1663482781778","yearId":null},"questionId":"778145656677078165","questionNumber":"Ⅳ"}],"title":""}],"templateId":"118919","templateName":"UNIT 6(5)"},"msg":null}
