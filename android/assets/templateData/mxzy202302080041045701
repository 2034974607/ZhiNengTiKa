some people born clever，and others born stupid? Or is intelligence developed by our environment and our experience? Strangely enough，the answer to these questions is yes.To some extent our intelligence is given to us at birth，and no amount of education can make a genius(天才) out of a child born with low intelligence.On the other hand，a child who lives in a boring environment will develop his intelligence less than one who lives in rich and varied surroundings(环境). Thus the limits of a person&rsquo;s intelligence are fixed at birth，whether or not he reaches those limits will depend on his environment.This view，now held by most experts，can be supposed in a number of ways.</p><p>It is easy to show that intelligence is to some extent something we are born with.The closer the blood relationship between two people，the closer they are likely to be intelligent.Thus if we take two unrelated people at random from population，it is likely that their degree of intelligence will be completely different.If，on the other hand，we take two identical twins，they will be very likely to be as intelligent as each other.Relations like brothers and sisters，parents and children，usually have similar intelligence，and this clearly suggests that intelligence depends on birth.</p><p>Imagine now that we take two identical(完全相同的) twins and put them in different environments.We might send one，for example，to a university and the other to a factory where the working is boring.We would soon find differences in intelligence developing，and this shows that environment as well as birth plays a part.This conclusion is also suggested by the fact that people who live in close contact with each other，but who are not related at all are likely to have similar degree of intelligence.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2023-02-16T15:43:40","decipherment":"本文是一篇说明文。文章主要讲述了在某种程度上人的智力是天生的，但是随着环境的变化、经验的增长，人的智商也在随之增长。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":null,"difficultyName":null,"gradeId":null,"id":"832884004788114805","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":2,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":3711198,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2023-02-16T07:57:24.125","uploadBatch":"1676533420945","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"ordered":12,"question":{"answer":"D","answerExplanation":"<p>上文讲的是双方都很忙碌，可能很难有时间给对方打电话，D项&ldquo;尽量找个双方都有空的时间去打电话，并坚持下去&rdquo;给出了解决没时间打电话这个问题的方法，符合题意。选项中的a
