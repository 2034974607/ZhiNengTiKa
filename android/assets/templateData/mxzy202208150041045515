I&rsquo;d ever seen.Even though it was made in black and white，it was so lively that my mind seemed to fill in color in every scene(场景)．Burton talked to me about why he chose to use black and white and 3D technology for <i>Franken</i><i>w</i><i>eenie</i>.&ldquo;I like the depth and shadows(阴影) that you can get with black and white，&rdquo; he said.&ldquo;And I just thought the 3D technology would be really fun to see.&rdquo;</p><p>He&rsquo;s right.The whole movie is a lot of fun.A school student Victor Frankenstein lives in a small town，whose dog Sparky is hit by a car one day.Victor is very sad and lonely until he brings the dog back to life inspired by an experiment of his science teacher about the power of electricity.Victor&rsquo;s classmates learn what happens and also try to bring their pets back from the dead.These creatures end up with causing widespread damage throughout the town.Finally，the dog gives up its own life to save Victor.</p><p>My favorite part is the moment when Victor brings Sparky back to life，because I have a very strong love for animals.This scene isn&rsquo;t the funniest，but it is really heart-warming to me.</p><p>I&rsquo;d like to recommend this movie to kids because of the unusual and lively characters.And it does attract those who are interested in cartoon techniques to see this film.The effects will blow your mind out of the water.Be sure to check out this exciting movie in theaters.</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-09-18T14:31:58","decipherment":"本文是一篇说明文。文章描述了一部非常吸引人的科幻动画片《弗兰肯维尼》，并极力推荐孩子们去观看。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":null,"difficultyName":null,"gradeId":null,"id":"778145391190217854","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":2830889,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2022-09-18T14:31:58","uploadBatch":"1663482718466","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"ordered":11,"question":{"answer":"A","answerExplanation":"<p>根据空格前一句可知，我们大部分人通过网络与朋友保持联系，网络帮助我们解答作业疑难，寻找旅游的好地方，查找最新新闻。因此推断，A项&ldquo;你可以在网络上做这些事情&rdquo;承接上文。故选A。</p>","cityId":null,"content":"","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-09-18T14:31:58","decipherment":null,"deleted":false,"difficultyId":"10018","difficultyName":"基础题","gradeId":null,"id":"778145391236355203","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":false,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":"You
