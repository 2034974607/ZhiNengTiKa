to Gelb，although not everyone is born with the gifts and the capacities of Leonardo Da Vinci，it is possible for any person to use the fundamentals of Da Vinci&rsquo;s approach to learning to guide us toward the realization of our inner <u>Da</u><u>&nbsp;</u><u>Vinci</u>.One typical fundamental is curiosity.Curiosity is &ldquo;The desire to know is natural to good men.&rdquo; &mdash;Leonardo Da Vinci</p><p>The young Leonardo loved being in nature，showed an early gift for drawing and was fascinated by mathematics.Young Leonardo&rsquo;s Curiosity regarding education and mathematics especially often raised constant unsureness and difficulties for the teachers who taught him and continuously proved them to be wrong.Most children have in them endless amounts of curiosity and sense of wonder.Unfortunately for multiple reasons these qualities are lost as children reach adulthood，not Leonardo though.Perhaps one of his greatest characteristics was his willingness to question accepted knowledge.Leonardo&rsquo;s Curiosity never faded and fueled the lake of his genius for his entire life.Leonardo&rsquo;s motives were not money，women or loyalty to any church or person.His pursuits were pure: the long search for beauty and above all: truth.</p><p>Leonardo would wonder around asking questions he did not himself yet understand.He always carried a notebook with himself so that he could quickly write down hundreds of questions，ideas，thoughts，impressions and observations as they occurred.He was expectant and reliant only upon himself to answer his own questions.Being modest，he was not afraid to make mistakes and appear foolish.Leonardo accepted the feelings of unfamiliarity and foolishness.</p><p>His questions led him to designing a snorkel(水下呼吸器) as well as diving equipment and even a submarine and also inventing flying machines and a parachute.His curiosity took him under the water and into the

you ever imagined that your simple T-shirt could cool you down by up to 5℃ on these hot summer days? Thanks to a recent discovery，the possibility is getting closer.While there are many alternatives that manage to keep the body warm，this amazing invention aims to offer real relief for those who are eager to feel comfortable and fresh in the outdoors on extremely hot days.</p><p>Its inventors，engineers Ma Yaoguang of Zhejiang University and Tao Guangming of Huazhong University of Science and Technology in China，took a completely innovative approach.They designed a special textile that can absorb body heat and re-emit its energy into space as mid-infrared radiation(MIR)．This textile cools both the objects and their surroundings through a technique that is known as radiative cooling.Science reveals.This means that even when it looks like you are wearing a regular shirt，you are actually wearing a device that works like a mirror.</p><p>Research conducted at Stanford University in 2017 had already managed to cool the wearer by 3℃，but this previous trial was limited.So researchers still need to test the new approach to determine how effectively the new fabric cools while the wearers are standing or walking，and not directly facing the sky，like in their trials.They also need to examine and measure how well it works when T-shirts are not in close contact with the skin.</p><p>Inventors Yaoguang and Guangming are now looking out for textile manufacturers and clothing brands that are interested in using their fabric.They estimate that the new material will increase clothing manufacturing costs by just 10 percent.&ldquo;We can make it with mass production，which means everybody can get a T-shirt and the cost is basically the same as their old stuff，&rdquo; Yaoguang said.</p><p>So if you are an athlete or simply someone that has to deal with the extremely high temperatures，be patient because your days of feeling hot and bothered may be coming to an end!</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-11-04T14:38:44","decipherment":"这是一篇说明文。文章主要介绍了一种可以在炎热的天气里给人们降温的T恤，介绍了其工作原理以及未来的发展方向。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":null,"difficultyName":null,"gradeId":null,"id":"795179325329512286","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":4,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":3217376,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2022-11-04T07:01:24.366","uploadBatch":"1667543924804","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"ordered":36,"question":{"answer":"D","answerExplanation":"<p>根据本段首句&ldquo;Hobbies
