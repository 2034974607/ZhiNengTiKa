third-generation hybrid rice which was developed by Yuan Longping，the &ldquo;father of hybrid rice&rdquo;，and his team underwent its first public yield(产量) monitoring from Monday to Tuesday and achieved high output.The final yield of the tested variety，G3－1S/P19，came to 1046.3 kg per mu (about 667 square meters)，based on two plots of land in Qingzhu Village under the city of Hengyang in central China&rsquo;s Hunan Province.</p><p>&ldquo;Some previous high-yielding hybrid rice varieties in China took 160 to even 180 days from sowing to harvesting，while the figure was shortened to around 125 days for the new variety.This is one of the most important characteristics of the third-generation hybrid rice that can reduce the use of pesticides and fertilizers，thus reducing cost and improving production efficiency，&rdquo; said Qian Qian，the deputy director of the China National Rice Research Institute.</p><p>Unlike the previous two generations that required a large amount of water and fertilizers as well as demanding growing conditions and technological support，the third-generation hybrid rice is easier to be cultivated by ordinary farmers.So the soil，altitude and climate of the test site were not &ldquo;ideal conditions&rdquo; carefully selected beforehand but were close to the paddies of ordinary farmers.</p><p>Nowadays，China&rsquo;s average yield of rice is about 500 kg per mu.Ordinary farmers can produce 600 kg to 700 kg of rice per mu by growing some excellent second-generation hybrid rice varieties.However，under the same planting conditions and environment，the yield of the third-generation hybrid rice could reach 800 kg per mu.China now feeds around 20 percent of the world&rsquo;s population with less than 9 percent of the world&rsquo;s arable(可耕种的) land.</p><p>At present，Yuan&rsquo;s team has nine third-generation hybrid rice combinations under trial，which are expected to achieve commercial seed production in the following three to four years and hope to apply the technology into the research of sea rice.The third-generation hybrid rice has the comprehensive strength to promote a greener and more sustainable development of China&rsquo;s rice production with higher quality and yield.</p><p><img src = 'https://img.xinjiaoyu.com/jby_files/prod/product_questions/66cc158fd6134126be354d7d8dba12691.png' width=\"583\"
