by Mary Shelley，turned 200 years old in 2018! It has been called the first true work of science fiction and the first English horror novel.The story has been told over and over again&mdash;not just in books，but in movies and television shows.To celebrate，New York City&rsquo;s Morgan Library &amp; Museum has a special exhibit on the writer and the book.</p><p>The reason for the success is that Doctor Frankenstein and his creature，the monster，live on in numerous remakes，shows，and even comic books.</p><p>Mary Shelley&rsquo;s classic is one of the most famous horror stories of all time.But <i>Frankenstein</i> is so much more than that.It presents ideas or themes that are still important today.Knowing something about her suffering can help readers have a good knowledge of her work.Shelley wrote the book when she was only 18 years old.And it relates to her own sad life.Her mother died 10 days after she gave birth to her.She knew what it meant to be a child without a mother.It is no surprise that Shelley wrote a story about a motherless creature one that is very much alone in the world.</p><p>Losing her mother shortly after her birth in 1797 was only part of her life story.Mary Shelley gave birth to four children，but only one child survived to adulthood.</p><p>Around the age of 17，she fell in love with the poet Percy Shelley.The two writers got married in 1816.However，the marriage of Percy and Mary Shelley was short-lived.Her husband died in a sailing accident in 1822.She was still in her twenties when she became a widow.In some ways，it&rsquo;s not entirely surprising that she ended up with a story about a monster without a mother.</p><p>After the publication of <i>Frankenstein</i>，Mary Shelley continued to write.She died from brain cancer on February 1,1851.Her most important legacy is a monster that is still very much alive today.</p><p><img src = 'https://img.xinjiaoyu.com/jby_files/prod/product_questions/2ca79d34023843219583d3a3c0aa60de1.png' width=\"583\"
