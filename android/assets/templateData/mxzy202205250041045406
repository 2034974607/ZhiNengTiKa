you ever caught yourself saying，&ldquo;I hate small talk！&rdquo; the minute you walk into a party? If so，you might be an introvert(内向的人)．Introverts hate to chat about &ldquo;small&rdquo; subjects with people.They are fine when you talk one on one but seem to get lost in the crowd when there&rsquo;s a group around.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re talking to an introvert，you might find that your first few conversations go one of two ways.Either they&rsquo;ll seem to get bored and not say much or they&rsquo;ll seem to skate over small talk in favor of more in-depth topics.What you need to know is that the introvert is not being rude.It&rsquo;s just that they don&rsquo;t like small talk.Here&rsquo;s why.</p><p>Small talk serves as a gateway toward deeper conversation.Some introverts don&rsquo;t realize that small talk will actually help them get to the bigger topics.You don&rsquo;t need to stay on small talk forever.However，sometimes introverts feel that even the short amount of time it takes to get into the real conversation is a waste of time.Small talk is very fast.Someone says something and this should be followed up with a quick response.But introverts like to chew on their words before saying them aloud.Before they answer，they&rsquo;ll <u>mull</u><u>&nbsp;</u><u>over</u> different thoughts.</p><p>Small talk by its very nature invites more people to join in.The more people who join the conversation，the more the introvert will tend to step back.As a result，they&rsquo;ll be quiet.Small talk is about throwing out subjects in the hope that one or more of them can be turned into a common point of interest.</p><p>The listening involved with small talk is not in-depth.The purpose is about listening &ldquo;lightly&rdquo; so you can figure out the right topics to spend some time on.Introverts tend to be great listeners，but they use active listening rather than light listening.This makes them wonderful friends，but can also make it difficult for new people to understand why they&rsquo;re so quiet.</p><p><img src =

grey squirrels(松鼠) and Mary Krupa became friends during Mary Krupa&rsquo;s first week at Penn State University.After seeing them running around，she wondered what they would look like with tiny hats on their heads.Today，everyone at the university knows her as the &ldquo;Squirrel Girl&rdquo;．</p><p>Mary started bringing them food，and gradually they began to trust her.She managed to put a hat on a squirrel and take a picture.Thinking that her friends could use something to lift their spirits，she started posting those photos on Facebook.The response(回应) was greatly positive，and before long Mary and her squirrels became very famous on the Internet.</p><p>Growing up in a neighbourhood outside State College，Mary was always fond of birds and animals around her home，but she didn&rsquo;t communicate with people very much.She was later diagnosed(诊断) with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome(埃斯博格综合征)，but the squirrels changed that.&ldquo;Being together with the squirrels is actually a good way to break the ice，because I&rsquo;ll be sitting here touching a squirrel and other people will come over and we&rsquo;ll just start like feeding the squirrels together and chatting about them，&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;I am a lot more outgoing.&rdquo;</p><p>Perhaps you&rsquo;re wondering how Mary is able to get the squirrels to do what she wants for her photos.Actually，it has a lot to do with food.For example，whenever she wants them to hold or play with something，she puts peanut butter on a plate，and they&rsquo;ll grab(抓住) it.But getting to that part took a while.In the beginning，she would throw peanuts up the trees on campus and invite the squirrels to come down and get them，but they didn&rsquo;t want to approach her.She had the patience to earn their trust，though.</p><p>This year，Mary graduated with a degree in wildlife science.She wants to be a science writer and educate people about how to protect the environment.As for her furry friends，Mary plans to stay in the area and visit them as often as she can.</p><p><img src = 'https://img.xinjiaoyu.com/jby_files/prod/product_questions/531330c917d74328bb70122181127fc61.png' width=\"559\"
