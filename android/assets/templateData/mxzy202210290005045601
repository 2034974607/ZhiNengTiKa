In some cases，when relationships last for this long (with a person or a career) it can be difficult to tell if you still want to be in it for the long run.Here are some signs that you've found the one you love.</p><p><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>2</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>.</p><p>There is always a constant stream of work coming in.But you don't let it paralyze you.There is so much to be done because you keep getting it done.You're in the work flow，baby.Hemingway always stopped writing when he had more to say.This is you at work.There's always a to-do list ready to go the next day.</p><p>Remind yourself of the &ldquo;bigger picture&rdquo;．</p><p>There are always going to be little ordinary tasks that have to get finished&mdash;even if we don't want to be the one to finish them. <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>3</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>. It's even easier to get focused on how difficult and time consuming the little projects can be.But when you love the work you do，you always find a way to see the forest through the trees and remind yourself of what you are working toward.</p><p>Get inspired by the people around you.</p><p>The things they seem to accomplish can be really impressive.You admire their determination in their work and you want to support them any way you can so that they can keep being awesome.You love what you are all working toward collectively as a team. <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>4</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>.
