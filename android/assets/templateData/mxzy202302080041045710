long ago，as my daughter and I were arriving at my son&rsquo;s basketball practice，an airplane flew over us.</p><p>&ldquo;Are they coming to bomb(轰炸) us，Daddy？&rdquo; she asked，moving closer to me.My daughter told me she&rsquo;d heard something at school&mdash;a news story about an airport and bombs and people getting killed.We talked a bit about the story she&rsquo;d heard，about how terrible things do happen sometimes，then I promised her that the airplane roaring above wasn&rsquo;t going to harm us.</p><p>In today&rsquo;s culture with mass media，families are surrounded by stories of shootings，bombings and other violent news.Our kids won&rsquo;t fully understand these stories，but they&rsquo;ll be frightened just the same.As parents，we need to help them have the necessary facts to process these terrible events and a broader understanding to ease their fears.</p><p>A child&rsquo;s world is pretty small，and kids may think that the terrible news events they&rsquo;ve heard about are just across town or right next door.They might ask if it&rsquo;s safe to go to a mall，or as in the case with my daughter，if the airplane roaring overhead is going to attack.Depending on the terrible events，kids may also believe a number of inaccuracies that are spread at school or from conversations with friends.So correct whatever exaggerations(夸张) or inaccuracies they may have heard.One of the first things I talk about with my kids is simple geographic distance.We look at a map or globe and talk about where the terrible events happened and how far away it is from our home.</p><p>To tell the truth，but don&rsquo;t describe information that will deepen fears.Your goal as a parent is to help your kids feel safe and learn how to handle stress.Children are comforted by the safety their parents provide，knowing that even if bad things happen，the family will get through it together.This creates what scientists call &ldquo;tolerable(可忍受的)
