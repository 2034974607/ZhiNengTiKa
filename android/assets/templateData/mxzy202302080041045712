influenced。</p><p>2．考查非谓语动词。分析句子成分可知，空处为非谓语动词表示目的，所以用动词不定式，句首字母需大写。故填To arrive。</p><p>3．考查名词的复数。experiment是可数名词，前面有&ldquo;a series of&rdquo;修饰，所以用复数形式。故填experiments。</p><p>4．考查非谓语动词。表示&ldquo;旨在做某事&rdquo;为aim at doing sth.，所以空处为动名词作介词的宾语。故填improving。</p><p>5．考查连词。根据句意和&ldquo;either into their own parking meters(停车计时器)<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> in others&rsquo; nearby&rdquo;可知，此处表示前后选择关系，所以用either...or...表示&ldquo;要么&hellip;&hellip;要么&hellip;&hellip;&rdquo;。故填or。</p><p>6．考查副词。分析句子成分可知，空处位于句首作状语，修饰整个句子，所以要用副词，句首字母需大写。故填Interestingly。</p><p>7．考查形容词的比较级。根据句意和&ldquo;than those&rdquo;可知，此处应用形容词great的比较级，表示&ldquo;表现出更大的快乐&rdquo;。故填greater。</p><p>8．考查名词。根据空前的&ldquo;a good&rdquo;可知，空处为名词单数，explanation意为&ldquo;解释&rdquo;，符合题意。故填explanation。</p><p>9．考查定语从句。分析句子成分可知，空处引导非限制性定语从句，修饰前面整个句子，且关系词在从句中作主语，所以用which引导。故填which。</p><p>10．考查冠词。表示&ldquo;对&hellip;&hellip;有影响&rdquo;为have an influence on，因为有positive修饰，且其发音以辅音音素开头，所以用不定冠词a。故填a。</p>","cityId":null,"content":"<p>语法填空</p><p>New research published by a team of psychologists at the University of Missouri-Columbia suggests
