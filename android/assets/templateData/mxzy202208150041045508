jobs at a young age and make it fun，encourage，praise and thank them，it quickly becomes normal and a part of life.Kids who are given different responsibilities grow up with a much greater sense of self-worth，self-esteem and are more confident.As the children grow，their responsibilities grow and expand.</p><p>Doing everything for children or not allowing them to make mistakes and learn from them is not being a positive，responsible parent.The kids will more than likely end up with bad attitudes，and usually have no respect for their parents or other adults and at times have no respect for themselves.When your kids are ready to leave home，they should be responsible，capable and confident.</p><p>It is my opinion that parents are to be thanked or to be blamed(责备) for just how kids take control of their lives.They are a product of their environment，mirroring what they have seen and what you have taught them.Parenting is the hardest job in the world and none of us are perfect，but it is our job!</p>","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-09-18T14:29:06","decipherment":"本文是一篇夹叙夹议文。文章讲述了作者的一些自身教育经验来建议父母教育他们的孩子成为一个负责任的人，这对孩子的成长有利无害。","deleted":false,"difficultyId":null,"difficultyName":null,"gradeId":null,"id":"778144667890881606","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":true,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":null,"optionB":null,"optionC":null,"optionD":null,"optionE":null,"optionF":null,"optionG":null,"options":[],"origin":1,"paperTypeId":null,"parentId":"0","pickCount":0,"provinceId":null,"questionNumber":null,"questionSerialNo":2830704,"questionVideo":null,"relateKnowledge":null,"scoreBasis":null,"source":null,"title":null,"typeDetailId":"1","typeDetailName":"单选题","typeId":"57","typeName":"阅读理解","updateBy":"35993","updateName":null,"updateTime":"2022-09-18T14:29:06","uploadBatch":"1663482546023","yearId":null},"questionId":null,"questionNumber":null},{"answer":null,"answerStatus":null,"childQuestionList":[{"answer":null,"answerStatus":6,"childQuestionList":null,"chooseGroup":null,"chooseGroupQuestionList":null,"isAnswer":false,"isChooseGroup":null,"isGroupQuestion":null,"isMistake":null,"ordered":11,"question":{"answer":"E","answerExplanation":"<p>上文提示&ldquo;课后复习是很有必要的，这样你才能真正理解、记忆和运用所学的知识。在考试前复习也很重要&rdquo;。再根据空格下文都是关于复习的建议可知，E项(下面是一些如何复习好的建议)切题。故选E。</p>","cityId":null,"content":"","createBy":"35993","createName":null,"createTime":"2022-09-18T14:29:06","decipherment":null,"deleted":false,"difficultyId":"10019","difficultyName":"中档题","gradeId":null,"id":"778144667949601866","isCharged":false,"isGroupQuestion":false,"isSubjective":false,"lineNumber":1,"oldId":null,"optionA":"Get
