is often the case，childhood was the happiest time of our lives.But，that was not <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>1</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> for me，at least between the ages of 10 to 12.I was practically <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>2</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> by my parents，who seemed only interested in their never-ending money making.I was <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>3</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>，a loner at school too，disliked by my classmates for getting good grades.</p><p>Longing for <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>4</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>，I fell into despair and started thinking about death.While on the school field trip，I lost my footing and slipped into a marsh(沼泽) and got my <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>5</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> muddy.As luck would have it，out of nowhere，an angel，in the <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>6</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> of a native woman，lent me a helping hand.She <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>7</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> me to her small cottage and helped me change my wet trousers.She made me eat from <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>8</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> little food she had，and told me funny stories，<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>9</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> to cheer me up.</p><p>That lady saved me.She saved my belief in the <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>10</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> of people.I came to realize that whatever happens，there are good things in the world，which you can <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>11</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> for existence.Another thing I noticed was that the lady，though she lived in <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>12</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> surroundings，seemed delighted.I realized that life is beautiful if we love it.Only those who are <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>13</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> their life can really understand what happiness really is.</p><p>I dropped the idea of ending my <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>14</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>.</p><p>I must thank that kind lady for what I had never experienced till then.<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u><u>15</u><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> someone&rsquo;s life with kindness is worth all the treasure in the
